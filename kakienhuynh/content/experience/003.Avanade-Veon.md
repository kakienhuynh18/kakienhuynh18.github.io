Customer Satisfaction Report Generator:
Ka Kien has created a Customer Satisfaction App for ITSupport. This allows the user who comes with a problem to provide their satisfaction as feedback. Linked to this is a report generator that triggers once a week to retrieve the satisfaction of the past week for the weekly meeting between the manager and the director.

Invoice Approval System:
Designed an invoice approval system for the Procurement team. This allows the user to digitally fill in invoices, generate them and have them approved by the relevant persons. Previously, this was a manual process by the assistants who had to print everything out and scan it again.
