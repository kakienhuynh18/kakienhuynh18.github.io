# Selling your ideas in corporate

When you’re in a corporate environment, communication skills are important. But what actually are these so called communication skills and how can we learn and practice these skills? The goal of my posts is to share my personal experiences with the world and my journey into learning these skills. Mostly describing the hurdles which I could and could not solve.

In corporate you have a variety of stakeholders, but how can you as a expendable software engineer create impact and sell your ideas? We start of by understanding the frameworks and pipelines which are set in place; and understanding why these are set in place. A software engineer is nothing more than a coding monkey that is expendable. A mere resource which sole responsibility is to implement the vision and product of the stakeholders. This dynamic alone means that the expendable software engineer is not involved in the ideation of the product, merely the creation and implementation of it.

So how can you actually sell your ideas and make impact? As of writing, I do not have an answer to that. I will explain one of my past experiences and reflect on my mistakes; How I could have tackled things differently.

I was working for a company called Hamtaro (fictional name). Hamtaro can be defined as a public sector company which is in the progress of migrating one of it’s Mission-Critical websites from on-premise to the cloud. After the lift-and-shift was completed, I was onboarded onto the project to implement more cloud-native services into the system. The problem of the current solution was that it was using VM instances which were _scaled manually_ to a maximum of 4 instances. My idea was to migrate it to a PaaS service so that the scaling will be automatic. This is a very simplified explanation of the problem and solution, which omits all the intricate details and dynamics within the company. This is just to give you a problem to visualize. In reality, to the stakeholders this was _not important_.

The merit to the stakeholders with change which comes from bottom-up is none. It is a risk when change is coming from bottom-up. When it’s top-down it’s an accomplishment to the people on top. The people on top create the ideas. The people on the bottom create their product. It is this dynamic which stands in the way of the people on the bottom to create ideas. They always need the approval of the people on top to approve this idea. They need to **sell** their ideas.

I will tell you about what my choices were and why I, in hindsight, think was wrong. My idea of selling my idea was to convince the people in my direct vicinity. These were my team members. Obviously they would support technological sound ideas, as they understand the technology. After that convincing the product owner of my idea. Same story, he deals with the aftermath of the problems all the time and understands the technological capabilities. After that, it was out of my hands to further push my idea as I though that it was not in my role to convince the people further up the chain.

GRAVE MISTAKE.

The result of my actions were that this idea never got further iterated than a proof-of-concept.

I will point out the things which I did wrong and how I learnt from it.

Mistake 1: My role should not be to sell my idea to people in my direct vicinity. I don’t need to as they are not the one who needs to approve of my ideas. I need to sell it to the business. Now who are the business? It’s everyone in the company.

Mistake 2: Letting others sell your idea. What happens when you let other people sell your idea instead of yourself? You put the fate of your idea in others hands. While this can be valid, it ultimately is detrimental to your own personal development. You want to be noticed and appreciated for your work and the impact that you make. By doing this, you give up the satisfaction and goals you could potentially achieve.

Mistake 3: Assuming that I can’t sell my own ideas. Everyone is a salesman. Assuming that you yourself are not and cannot sell something is blasphemy. This thought undermines your own capabilities and potential. Who is best at selling an idea? The one who puts the most effort in it. On the project it was me who spent the most time on refining the idea. It should have been me to sell my own ideas to the business.
