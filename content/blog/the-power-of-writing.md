# The Power of Writing

What skill is often overlooked and undervalued in your opinion? In my opinion it would be writing. Humans are naturally social beings. We must communicate with each other. It is in our nature to do so. Communicating with each other helps us understand each other. It helps us to be compassionate. It is also a means of exchanging ideas. Vastly different people can come to an understanding by communicating with each other; Building rapport.

“Think before you speak”. How often have we heard this phrase before? I at least grew up hearing this countless times. But what does it mean? What do you need to think about exactly? Why do people say that? People say that you have to be considerate of your words. Considerate to what? Not hurting the other person’s feelings?

In a way, yes! But it’s not only to be considerate of what you want to say. To me, the “think” part means that you actually take the time to process the information the other person has just conveyed to you. It means to listen to the words and digest the information.

Now how does this relate to writing? When you talk to people, communication happens in real-time. You don’t get nearly enough time to digest all the information that is thrown at you. Yet, you will still be able to reply to them. Human minds are complex. It needs time to process all the information that you take in throughout the day.

So why writing? Writing is a form of communication that doesn’t happen in real-time. When you write, you have the time to think about what and how you are going to convey something. Imagine all the times in a conversation where you in hindsight would have replied differently than the answer that you gave at that moment. I for sure have that happen countless of times.

Thinking is a way of processing the information (either consciously or subconsciously). Whereas writing is a way of condensing and organizing the information. There might be no one there to read it, but if there is, then writing opens a whole new world of skills to explore. Writing makes you think about how you are going to convey the message to others, but also to yourself. Digesting and processing information, especially in the digital age, is extremely important.

In a world where information is readily available and everything screams for attention, how will you keep it all manageable for your brain? ‘Information overload’ is a real. It makes us non-productive. What happens when you make your mind process more information than it can handle? Just like what happens when you overload your body, your mind will also give out after a certain point. It will discard information; a backlog of information is created to be processed at another point in the future. We all have heard about people who are tired on their days off, just to proceed with doing nothing in their weekends and still be tired! Your mind needs time!

In my point of view, making writing a habit is very helpful into forcing your mind to process that information. It also helps if you create an environment where you are not constantly distracted by everything that screams for attention. Even if no one is going to read it, so what? It’s ultimately an exercise for a healthy mind!
