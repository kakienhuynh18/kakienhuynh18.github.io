### First try at front-end development

In my role as Full-stack Developer at the AFM, I was partly responsible for the further development of the AFM portal within 3 teams of 6 - 9 people. I contributed to the front-end development in Angular. I also set up CI/CD pipelines for the cloud-native integration solutions within Azure.

I was responsible for:
- Setting up CI/CD using ARM and Bicep
- Developing an Azure function to retrieve and save documents in SharePoint
- Integrating a new service in Azure API Management
- Setting up Hybrid connections for Azure Functions for connection with SharePoint on-premise
- Knowledge sharing sessions within the 3 development teams
- Expanding the front-end portal with new functionality

### Internal Event Registration App

For an internal event from Cegeka, both internal employees and external customers can register. On the day itself, speakers will come along with a limited number of capacity in the room. I was asked to put together a tool in the short term that meets this requirement.

I have developed a PowerApp Event Registration tool for this. This low-code solution is completely low-code and reusable for multiple events. The only limitation is that people who do not have a cegeka (guest) account cannot register themselves.
