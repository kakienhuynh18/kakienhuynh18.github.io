### Cloud migration from IaaS solution to PaaS solution

At Rijkswaterstaat, the website www.rijkswaterstaat.nl has been marked by the government as a Mission-Critical website. This means that in the event of natural disasters, for example, the website must still be operational.

In my role I was responsible for setting up the Proof-of-Concept: Web Apps Migration. This demonstrated that the migration of the current architecture landscape towards a PaaS solution within Azure has no negative consequences that cannot be mitigated. This increases the robustness of the system, while at the same time reducing the management burden.

I was responsible for the following improvements in the entire system:
- Health probing added to the architecture landscape to detect faulty links at an early stage
- Setting up and integrating Key Vault into the current architecture
- Investigating pain points in the old git strategy
- Introducing the 10% rule to discover single points of failure
- Smoother communication between development/test and management team
- More knowledge transfer sessions within the team
- Focus more on the future instead of constantly finishing backlog items
- Coaching junior colleagues
