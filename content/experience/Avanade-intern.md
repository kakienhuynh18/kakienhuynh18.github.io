### Graduation internship on the efficiency of Virtual Reality as a replacement of a training manual

As part of my graduation thesis, I conducted research into the effectiveness of a Virtual Reality training compared to the picturestique manual. For this, I took a simple bookcase from IKEA for the project.
The whole instruction manual was analyzed and made into the Virtual Reality training. 

For the training, I made use of the fact that in a VR world you can see animations. In this way I programatically replicated the steps into an animation on how to build the book case.

Audio instructions were conisdered and a working prototype with text-to-speech was implemented in Unity3D as a way of showcasing the possibilities. It was not used in the actual training as the text-to-speech functionality did not support the Dutch language.

A/B user testing was performed on this to compare the results and the results were compared based on time and the amount of times they consulted the manual
