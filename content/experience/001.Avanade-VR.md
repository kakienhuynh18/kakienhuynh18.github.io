### Graduation internship on the efficiency of Virtual Reality as a replacement of a training manual

As part of my graduation thesis, I conducted research into the effectiveness of a Virtual Reality training compared to a manual. An IKEA manual was used as an example. For this, I developed a training in Virtual Reality to replace the IKEA manual. A/B user testing was performed on this to compare the results. Furthermore, it was also examined whether Text-to-Speech has an effect on the effectiveness.
