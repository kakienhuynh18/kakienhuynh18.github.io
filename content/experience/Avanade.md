# Life at Avanade

After graduating I started my career at Avanade as an IT Analyst. I have performed a wide variety of tasks and roles during my time at Avanade. 

### Gaining Insights on Scrum Team using PowerBI

For Essent (Dutch Utility Company) I have developed a PowerBI Dashboard to provide insights into the lead time of tasks of the internal scrum team. This is used by the management for gaining insights into which tasks have a long lead time.

### Streamlining IT processes at Veon

Customer Satisfaction Report Generator:

I have created a Customer Satisfaction App for ITSupport. This allows the user who comes with a problem to provide their satisfaction as feedback. Linked to this is a report generator that triggers once a week to retrieve the satisfaction of the past week for the weekly meeting between the manager and the director.

Invoice Approval System:

Designed an invoice approval system for the Procurement team. This allows the user to digitally fill in invoices, generate them and have them approved by the relevant persons. Previously, this was a manual process by the assistants who had to print everything out and scan it again.

### Rate Card Generator

In my role as PowerApps developer at DLL (Financial Leasing Comapany), I was responsible for creating a Rate Card Generator. DLL lends money at interest. Behind the interest determination is a complex formula to calculate the optimal interest rate. This depends on a variaty of factors such as: the amount, the duration, the euro exchange rate, etc.

In my role I have drawn up the functional requirements of the business owner and translated them into technical requirements. Based on the technical requirements, I have developed a Power App.
The application:
- Generates a Rate Card based on given parameters
- Rate Card can be manually adjusted afterwards if necessary
- Generates a PDF of the Rate Card
- Sends the PDF to person 1 for approval
- Then sends it to person 2 for approval
- Then sends the PDF to the customer

### Migrating BizTalk to Azure Cloud Native

For PWN (utilities company) I was responsible for managing the entire Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) solution within a team of 4 developers. I was also co-responsible for migrating the on-premise integrations towards Cloud Native solutions within Azure.

The solution consists of two parts: event-driven and api-driven. The event-driven integrations are used for services where fire-and-forget applies. The rest of the integrations are SOAP or Restfull APIs.

My responsibilities were:
- PrintKopieService. PWN has an archive of all customer communication. Documents (in HTML) are also stored in this. The PrintKopieService is used to convert the document to PDF and then forward it to a third party. This third party then decides on printing and sending the copy. - Azure monitoring to gain insight into service load
- Drawing architecture for the various services
- Migrating Biztalk towards Azure Integration Services
- Migrating on-premise WCF services towards Azure App Services
- Unlocking service endpoints in Azure API Management
- Azure alerts for incorrect events/runs

I also gave an internal presentation within PWN about Testing. This includes Unit Testing, integration testing and UI testing
